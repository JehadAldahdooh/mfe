Description: Extracts meta-features from datasets to support recommendation 
  systems based on Meta-Learning. The meta-features, also called 
  characterization measures, are able to describe datasets about the complexity 
  and provide evidences  about the performance of algorithms. The package 
  contains the standard and the state of the art characterization measures with 
  the goal to improve the Meta-Learning experiments and also guide the 
  complexity dataset understanding. These measures are described in the book:
